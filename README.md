# ansible-tower
Ansible Tower dockerized. This image is based on https://github.com/ybalt/ansible-tower.

## Build

The Image is build by travis-ci and pushed automatically to Dockerhub. Unfornatunaly due to the installation method ending up in a running http-instance, Dockerhub is not able to build this image. Therefore we are force to use travis-ci.

## Run

Mounts for settings (/etc/tower), postgres (/var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main), data (/var/lib/awx) and logs (/var/log/apache2, /var/log/postgresql, /var/log/supervisor, /var/log/tower) must exist. Otherwise, the image won't start.

### /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main

* Mount for PostgresDB
* bootstrapable with "docker-compose ansible-tower run intialize", if folder and /var/lib/awx leer are empty

### /var/lib/awx

* Mount for awx-data
* bootstrapable with "docker-compose ansible-tower run intialize", if folder and /var/lib/postgresql/9.4/main leer are empty

### /etc/tower

* settings, must be present and can not be bootstrapped
* conf.d/ha.py is going to be copied within "initialize"-command, since its ID mus be in sync with the DB 

### /var/log/apache2, /var/log/postgresql, /var/log/supervisor, /var/log/tower

* mounts f√ºr logs
* can be empty
